# simple_word_counter

This program is an example of a concise, basic, completed project.

Its purpose is to exhibit that I am comfortable with Python syntax and convention.

Additionally, it incorporates several features to show what I am familiar with: reading in files, argument parsing, data parsing, iterating through data types, regular expression matching, python library usage, custom sorting, and my knowledge of python data structures: lists, dictionaries and strings.

**The exercise was taken from an online Python class taught by Google, however the code is entirely mine.**
