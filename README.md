# simple_word_counter

This program is an example of a concise, basic, completed project.

The purpose of this program is to exhibit that I am comfortable with Python syntax and convention.

Additionally, the program incorporates several features to show what I am familiar with: reading in files, argument parsing, data parsing, iterating through data types, regular expression matching, python library usage, custom sorting, and my knowledge of python data structures: lists, dictionaries and strings.

Included in this repository is a text file of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, to be used on the program to test its performace.

To call the program:
    **./wordcount.py {--count | --topcount} inputFile [outputFile]**

    *ex: ./wordcount.py --count alice.txt*

        The above command will output to the console a list of each unique word found in the text of alice.txt along with each word's count (the number of times it occurs)


**This exercise was taken from an online Python class taught by Google; however, the code is entirely mine.**
